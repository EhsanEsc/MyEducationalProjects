### 1. Socket programming with C

The purpose of this project is to learn basic socket programming with c by using its system calls. <br>
In this project, we should implement server to matchmake between clients with TCP communication and imlpement clients to play a game of "Dots and Boxes" with UDP communication.<br>
More details in "Description.pdf" file. There is an example of running a server and 3 clients in "logs" folder <br>
