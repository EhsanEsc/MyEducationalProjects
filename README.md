### 1. Socket programming with C

The purpose of this project is to learn basic socket programming with c by using its system calls. <br>
In this project, we should implement server to matchmake between clients with TCP communication and imlpement clients to play a game of "Dots and Boxes" with UDP communication.<br>
More details in "Description.pdf" file. There is an example of running a server and 3 clients in "logs" folder <br>

### 2. Process management and communication between them with C++

In this project, we calculate some queries on stores stuff. <br>
We create some process for each Province, City and Store and send query by unnammed pipe. They calculate query and returns result to its parent by using nammed pipe. <br>

### 3. Multi threding with C++

In this project, we analyse phone prices to calculate price class of each phone. <br>
We extract features of phones and store them. Then we normalize data and calculate price class based on pre trained model. After that, we calculate the precision of the model. <br>
At first we implement project with serial method. Then we analayze project to find "hotspot"s of code to run them paralell way. More detail of analyzing is available in "Report.pdf". Then we implement parallel method by using pthread library. <br>

### 4. Multi threading with Go

Project 3 implementation with Golang. <br>
It will be added soon! <br>
